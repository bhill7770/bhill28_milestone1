## Framworks: 

In preparation for this project, I wrote the initial lines of Python code on the VS code editor to employ the workings of Pythonâ€™s Flask to build a startup webpage. Pylint was useful in cleaning up the code. HTML and CSS provided the necessary elements to create and design a functionable webpage that is fairly user friendly. In order to dynamically fetch data from the required API keys (TMDB and Wikipedia), I need to import Json, "requests" as well as "OS" libraries to be able to read and store the data to load onto the webpage. Github, as a cloud based hosting service platform, allows for developers to keep track of Git repositories, which is useful for this assignment. Heroku assisted in building, running as well as operating the web application. 


## Known problems:

Some of the wikipedia links would not load at first but after extensive research I was able to properly link the wikipedia page to the associated movie. Also, I think it would be better if I included an array of some sort to iterate through the genre_ids to show the titles of the movie genre categories instead of the assigned TMBD values. On the webpage, I created a reference list for the user to be able to identify the categories but that may be a bit tedious for the user.  

## Persistent Known problems: 

One major problem that persists is that webpage is only showing fixed results instead of random selections. Unfortunately, that is one of the main requirements for this assignment but none of the solutions that I attempted has worked so far. I would like to add a search bar to the webpage but I ran out of time in trying to implement it into the webpage. I think it would be great for users to be able to search for a specific genre, actor/actress or title and have the information returned on the web page. Hopefully, in the meantime I can find a way to improve the status of the webpage by involving user input to search up related movie content.
